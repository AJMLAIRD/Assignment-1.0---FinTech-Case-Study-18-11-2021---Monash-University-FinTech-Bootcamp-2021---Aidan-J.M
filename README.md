CoinSpot was founded with the mission of helping Australians of any background to have easy access to the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Being one of the earliest exchanges, CoinSpot has managed to help millions of Australians purchase cryptocurrencies and is considered to be a safe, verified and trusted platform. Coinspot is a member of Blockchain Australia and is registered with AUSTRAC. 

The company charges deposit, withdrawal and trading fees which are relatively low. There are also spread fees, which is the difference between the buy and sell rate of any particular coin or token. 


## What is CoinSpot aiming to solve? 

As stated before, CoinSpot's mission is to help Australians obtain quick access to digital currencies. As crypto continues to become adopted and thought of as a legitimate asset, more Australians are looking for ways to obtain and invest in this sphere. CoinSpot aims to be the forefront of accessible and safe crypto exchanges. One major issue within the cryptosphere is the danger of leaving one's digital assets in an exchange. Hackers are prevelant and it is not uncommon to hear about investor's crypto assests being stolen. To combat this, CoinSpot offers its users to create vaults, where they can have their cryptocurrencies stored offline as part of a custodial service plan (similar to storing cryptocurrencies in a personal hardware wallet).
