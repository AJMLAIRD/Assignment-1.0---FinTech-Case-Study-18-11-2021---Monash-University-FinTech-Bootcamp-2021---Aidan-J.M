## Overview and Origin

Australia is quickly becoming a nation of crypto-ethusiasts, as more people from all walks of life and levels of finance continue to buy assets such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Cardano, as well as tokens on various blockchains such as Ethereum or Binance[^1]. The world of cryptocurrency or 'cryptosphere' is a significant domain in FinTech and will continue to be the forefront of the current financial revolution that is taking place[^2].


One company that continues to dominate in this area is CoinSpot, which is an Australian Crypto Exchange that is owned and operated by Casey Block Services PTY LTD. The company was founded in 2013 in Melbourne by Russel Wilson, who is quite active in the cryptosphere and shares many thoughts and opinions on why Australians should get involved with cryptocurrency, blockchain and decentralised finance[^3]


CoinSpot was founded with the mission of helping Australians of any background to have easy access to the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Being one of the earliest exchanges, CoinSpot has managed to help millions of Australians purchase cryptocurrencies and is considered to be a safe, verified and trusted platform. Coinspot is a member of Blockchain Australia and is registered with AUSTRAC[^4].


The company charges deposit, withdrawal and trading fees which are relatively low. There are also spread fees, which is the difference between the buy and sell rate of any particular coin or token[^5]. 

#### CoinSpot fees explained

* Market orders: 0.1%
* Instant buy, sell and swap: 1.0%
* Variable spread fees

#### CoinSpot enables Australian clients to deposit AUD into their account via the following methods and fees: 

* POLi: free
* PayID: free
* Direct deposit: free
* Bpay: 0.9%
* Cash: 2.5% 


## What is CoinSpot aiming to solve? 

As crypto continues to become adopted and thought of as a legitimate asset, more Australians are looking for ways to obtain and invest in this sphere. CoinSpot aims to be the forefront of accessible and safe crypto exchanges[^6]. 


One major issue within the cryptosphere is the danger of leaving one's digital assets in an exchange. Hackers are prevelant and it is not uncommon to hear about investor's crypto assests being stolen[^7]. To combat this, CoinSpot offers its users to create vaults, where they can have their cryptocurrencies stored offline as part of a custodial service plan (similar to storing cryptocurrencies in a personal hardware wallet)[^8]. 

Another significant issue with cryptocurrency exchanges is verification. Most centralised exchanges require users to verify their identity and will be limited to certain investing caps until the verification is complete. Wait times for popular platforms such as Binance can take over 10 days in some cases[^9]. However, CoinSpot prides itself by offering users with instant verification and increasing fiat deposit caps[^10]. 

Acording to some of the latest statistics, almost a quater of Australians invest and hold cryptocurrencies, particularily bitcoin[^11]. A significant ammount of these investors primarily use CoinSpot[^12]. When compared to international exchanges, CoinSpot's features appear to be geared towards the long-term investor. One of CoinSpot's competetors, Binance, is primarily a platform for experienced and seasoned crypto traders as it offers advanced charting tools, graphs, shorting and lower exchange fees. CoinSpot is successful in being extremely easy and accessible, while Binance's complicated interface is an indicator of the type of client mentioned above[^13]. 

One major product that CoinSpot offers is crypto bundles, where users can easily buy a range of different currencies with one purchase. Some excellent examples are the top 10 coins by market capitalisation, the Bitcoin bundle, the NFT bundle and the eco-friendly green bundle. Buying cryptocurrencies in a bundle allows one to essentially build a diversified portfolio quickly and the purchase fees are reduced compared to buying individual coins or tokens[^14].

Another great feature of CoinSpot is the ability to swap cryptocurrenices. Peer-to-peer blockchain swapping technology or "atomic swaps' is common in decentralised exchanges such as Uniswap as well as centralised exchanges such as CoinSpot and Coinbase. Atomic swaps gives users the ability to trade any token for another token[^15]. On CoinSpot, traders can swap Bitcoin for Ethereum or any of the 300+ listed coins and tokens and vice versa. The technology uses hash functions, which are intracate mathematical encryptions that ensures that the exchange of tokens is confirmed on the blockchain within a certain timeframe and successfully transfered[^16]. 

## How Crypto has changed

One of the major changes to cryptocurrency in the past decade is surprisingly the phenomenon of Bitcoin and other first generation cryptocurrencies being considered outdated[^17]. Bitcoin's original purpose has shifted from being a means to exchange to being a store of value[^18]. This is primarily due to the value of Bitcoin accelerating over 120 million percent throughout the last 10 years. It is also due to Bitcoin using the highly criticized proof-of-work protocal to validate transactions as most modern cryptocurrencies use proof-of-stake[^19]. 

With the conception and creation of the Ethereum network came tokens and the ability for programmers to create their own cryptocurrency projects[^20]. Decentalised apps (dapps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are now becoming more widespread, providing access to decentralised wealth creation opportunities[^21]. Major financial institutions are now opening their doors to crypto and offering their clients crypto and blockchain products and services[^22]. One such example in Australia is Commonwealth Bank who have recently announced that they will offer Commsec investors to buy and hold cryptocurrencies[^23]. 

CoinSpot's impact on the crypto industry in Australia is unmatched. The company has successfully created a platform that is regulated, safe and secure for the Australian investor[^24]. 

## Recommendations for CoinSpot

If I was to join CoinSpot as an advisor. I would suggest they offer crypto staking so that clients can earn more money and rewards by holding and investing in their currencies for a long period of time.

Crypto staking is the process of comitting one's assets to a proof-of-stake blockchain and essentially validating new transactions. The blockchain then rewards these validators with the currency itself. This is far more effective than the proof-of-work system used by older currencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin which require miners using large amounts of energy to validate new transactions on the blockchain[^25]. Ethereum was built using proof-of-work but will transition to proof-of-stake when Ethereum 2.0 is released in 2022[^26]. 

Popular international crypto exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and Kucoin offer staking, so in order to maintain competetiveness, it would be highly advised that CoinSpot adopt this for clients. 

The technology required for staking is not dependent on the exchange, but on how the token or coin is programmed, so it would not be a difficult process to employ staking within the exchange. 

Another service that CoinSpot should provide are high-interest crypto accounts. Although it is a relatively recent concept, it is nontheless highy lucrative for long-term holders. Companies such as BlockFi, Coinspot.com and WireX offer compound interest accounts for currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum as well as stable coins such as DAI[^27]. As more Australians start to learn and add cryptocurrencies to their portfolios, the concept of earning passive income through compound interest will entice and draw new customers.
