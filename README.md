## Overview and Origin

Australia is quickly becoming a nation of crypto-ethusiasts, as more people from all walks of life and levels of finance continue to buy assets such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Cardano, as well as tokens on various blockchains such as Ethereum or Binance. The world of cryptocurrency or 'cryptosphere' is a significant domain in FinTech and will continue to be the forefront of the current financial revolution that is taking place. 

One company that continues to dominate in this area is CoinSpot, which is an Australian Crypto Exchange that is owned and operated by Casey Block Services PTY LTD. The company was founded in 2013 in Melbourne by Russel Wilson, who is quite active in the cryptosphere and shares many thoughts and opinions on why Australians should get involved with cryptocurrency, blockchain and decentralised finance[^1]

CoinSpot was founded with the mission of helping Australians of any background to have easy access to the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Being one of the earliest exchanges, CoinSpot has managed to help millions of Australians purchase cryptocurrencies and is considered to be a safe, verified and trusted platform. Coinspot is a member of Blockchain Australia and is registered with AUSTRAC. 

The company charges deposit, withdrawal and trading fees which are relatively low. There are also spread fees, which is the difference between the buy and sell rate of any particular coin or token. 


## What is CoinSpot aiming to solve? 

As stated before, CoinSpot's mission is to help Australians obtain quick access to digital currencies. As crypto continues to become adopted and thought of as a legitimate asset, more Australians are looking for ways to obtain and invest in this sphere. CoinSpot aims to be the forefront of accessible and safe crypto exchanges. One major issue within the cryptosphere is the danger of leaving one's digital assets in an exchange. Hackers are prevelant and it is not uncommon to hear about investor's crypto assests being stolen. To combat this, CoinSpot offers its users to create vaults, where they can have their cryptocurrencies stored offline as part of a custodial service plan (similar to storing cryptocurrencies in a personal hardware wallet). 

Another significant issue with cryptocurrency exchanges is verification. Most centralised exchanges require users to verify their identity and will be limited to certain investing caps until the verification is complete. Wait times for popular platforms such as Binance can take over 10 days in some cases. However, CoinSpot prides itself by offering users with instant verification and increasing fiat deposit caps. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Acording to some of the latest statistics, almost a quater of Australians invest and hold cryptocurrencies, particularily bitcoin. A significant ammount of these investors primarily use CoinSpot. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## How Crypto has changed

One of the major changes to cryptocurrency in the past decade is surprisingly the phenomenon of Bitcoin and other first generation cryptocurrencies being considered outdated. Bitcoin's original purpose has shifted from being a means to exchange to being a store of value. This is primarily due to the value of Bitcoin accelerating over 120 million percent throughout the last 10 years. 

With the conception and creation of the Ethereum network came tokens and the ability for programmers to create their own cryptocurrency projects. Decentalised apps (dapps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are now becoming more widespread, providing access to decentralised wealth creation opportunities. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

## CoinSpot's impact in Australia
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

CoinSpots impact on the crypto industry in Australia is unmatched. The company has successfully created a platform that is regulated, safe and secure for the Australian investor. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?



* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

## Advise for CoinSpot 

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

If I was to join CoinSpot as an advisor. I would suggest they offer crypto staking and interest accounts so that clients can earn more money and rewards by holding and investing in their currencies for a long period of time.
